# CB-Hydration-Decompiled
 Keep track of your hydration! A normal program for normal people.

The decompiled files for CoyBuddles' Hydration Meter program.

BIG CREDIT: Darnoman's Global Input Addon for Godot. The program literally would not function without this. And it's also the majority of the program. All I did was make the meter.
Find the addon here: https://github.com/Darnoman/Godot-GlobalInput-Addon
